    "# Norwegian Salmon Health Crisis: 20 Years of Disease vs Production Expansion (2005-2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Executive Summary\n",
    "This analysis examines two decades of disease surveillance in Norwegian Atlantic salmon aquaculture, revealing critical insights about the relationship between industrial expansion and fish health. Despite a 42.5% increase in production licenses, disease patterns show complex dynamics; some infections declined dramatically due to vaccines while others increased, highlighting both successes and ongoing challenges in sustainable aquaculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Project Objectives\n",
    "1. **Quantify** the relationship between production expansion and disease incidence\n",
    "2. **Evaluate** the impact of vaccine introductions on target diseases  \n",
    "3. **Identify** emerging disease threats in modern salmon farming\n",
    "4. **Provide** data-driven recommendations for sustainable aquaculture\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Dataset Overview\n",
    "**Source:** Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries and Veterinary Institute  \n",
    "**Period:** 2005-2024 (20 continuous years)  \n",
    "**Records:** Annual disease case counts + production licenses  \n",
    "**Diseases Tracked:** 8 major salmon pathogens  \n",
    "**File:** `salmon_diseases_2005_2024.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Variables:\n",
    "- **Production Indicator:** Annual operational licenses\n",
    "- **Diseases Monitored:**\n",
    "  - ISA (Infectious Salmon Anaemia)\n",
    "  - IPN (Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis)\n",
    "  - PD (Pancreas Disease)\n",
    "  - HSMI (Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation)\n",
    "  - Furunculosis\n",
    "  - BKD (Bacterial Kidney Disease)\n",
    "  - CMS (Cardiomyopathic Syndrome)\n",
    "  - Cold-water vibriosis\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Pipeline\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, convert data types\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering:** Calculate derived metrics\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Visual trends and correlations\n",
    "4. **Statistical Modeling:** Regression and hypothesis testing\n",
    "5. **Interpretation:** Translate findings into insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Techniques\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics:** Temporal trends and distributions\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis:** Disease-disease and disease-license relationships\n",
    "- **Regression Models:** Linear, polynomial, and regularized regression\n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis:** Pre/post vaccine periods\n",
    "- **Time Series Analysis:** Lag effects and temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Analyses Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Disease Trend Visualization\n",
    "- Individual disease trajectories over 20 years\n",
    "- Peak incidence identification for each pathogen\n",
    "- Comparative burden assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Production-Disease Relationship\n",
    "- License growth vs. disease incidence correlation\n",
    "- Cases per license density metric\n",
    "- Time-lagged effects analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vaccine Impact Assessment\n",
    "- IPN vaccine (introduced ~2012) effectiveness\n",
    "- PD vaccine (introduced ~2017) outcomes\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing of reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Multivariate Analysis\n",
    "- Multiple regression: Total cases = f(Licenses, Year, Licenses²)\n",
    "- Regularized regression for feature importance\n",
    "- Residual diagnostics and model validation\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Stories:\n",
    "- **IPN Dramatic Reduction:** Cases dropped from 200+ to <30 annually post-2012 vaccination\n",
    "- **Effective Disease Management:** Overall cases per license trend shows improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emerging Concerns:\n",
    "- **CMS Increase:** Steady rise from ~70 to 150+ cases despite controls\n",
    "- **HSMI Variability:** Fluctuations suggest density-dependent challenges\n",
    "- **Recent BKD Resurgence:** Increase in 2023-2024 warrants attention\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production-Disease Insights:\n",
    "- **Positive Correlation:** CMS and HSMI scale with production\n",
    "- **Decoupled Success:** IPN reduced despite production growth (vaccine effect)\n",
    "- **Mixed Patterns:** Other diseases show complex, non-linear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Salmon Farmers:\n",
    "1. **Vaccine Priority:** Maintain IPN vaccination, consider PD vaccine adoption\n",
    "2. **Density Management:** Monitor CMS and HSMI in high-density operations\n",
    "3. **Surveillance Focus:** Enhanced monitoring for BKD resurgence\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Policymakers:\n",
    "1. **Vaccine Support:** Continue funding for effective immunization programs\n",
    "2. **Sustainable Growth:** Balance production expansion with health safeguards\n",
    "3. **Research Investment:** Target diseases without effective vaccines (CMS, BKD)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Industry Stakeholders:\n",
    "1. **Risk Assessment:** Consider disease burden in expansion planning\n",
    "2. **Technology Adoption:** Invest in advanced health monitoring systems\n",
    "3. **Collaborative Solutions:** Industry-wide disease management strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Results \n",
    "The analysis generates multiple outputs:\n",

    "##  Limitations & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Constraints:\n",
    "- Licenses as production proxy (not actual biomass)\n",
    "- Diagnostic improvements over time may affect case detection\n",
    "- Environmental factors not included in analysis\n",
    "- Possible underreporting in early years\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Limitations:\n",
    "- Small temporal sample (n=20 years)\n",
    "- Correlation does not imply causation\n",
    "- Multiple confounding factors in real world setting\n",
    "- No control group for natural experiment analysis\n",
